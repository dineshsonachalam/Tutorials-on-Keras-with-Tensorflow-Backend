    "# Multi Layer Perceptron and its basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like atoms form the basics of any material on earth – the basic forming unit of a neural network is a perceptron. So, what is a perceptron?\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron can be understood as anything that takes multiple inputs and produces one output. For example, look at the image below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The above structure takes three inputs and produces one output. The next logical question is what is the relationship between input and output? Let us start with basic ways and build on to find more complex ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I have discussed three ways of creating input output relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. By directly combining the input and computing the output</b> based on threshold value. For eg: Take x1=0, x2=1, x3=1 and setting a threshold =0. So, if <b> x1+x2+x3>0 </b>, the output is 1 otherwise 0. You can see that in this case, the perceptron calculates the output as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Next, let us add weights to the inputs. </b> <i>Weights give importance to an input.</i> For example, you assign w1=2, w2=3 and w3=4 to x1, x2 and x3 respectively. To compute the output, we will multiply input with respective weights and compare with threshold value as <b> w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 > threshold.</b> These weights assign more importance to x3 in comparison to x1 and x2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Next, let us add bias</b> Each perceptron also has a bias which can be thought of as how much flexible the perceptron is. <b>bias is somehow similar to the constant <i>b</i> of a linear function y = ax + b.</b> <i> It allows us to move the line up and down to fit the prediction with the data better.</i> Without b the line will always goes through the origin (0, 0) and you may get a poorer fit. For example, a perceptron may have two inputs, in that case, it requires three weights. One for each input and one for the bias. Now linear representation of input will look like, <b> w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 + 1*b.</b>\n",
